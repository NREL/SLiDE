Package version notes:
DataFrames version - 0.21.8 (DataFrames pushes PATHSolver up to 1.1.1)
PathSolver version - 0.6.2 --- (pushes up DataFrames and JuMP)
Complementarity version - 0.7.2 -- compatible with pathsolver 0.6.2
JuMP version - 0.21.4

add DataFrames@0.21.8
add PATHSolver@0.6.2
add JuMP@0.21.4

New version of JuMP no longer compatible with haskey() variable/equation filtering method

Trick is:
Build the slide benchmark with old Dataframes and jump version (and new pathsolver/complementarity)
Then run model with old PathSolver and Complementarity Versions (with new dataframes version)
packages require changes between build and modeling
