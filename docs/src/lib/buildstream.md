# Build Stream

*Overview of how BuildStream works to build the national model.*
There are four steps required to build the cleaned input data for use in the model.

1. **Partition**. Divide BEA supply/use data into parameters.
2. **Calibrate**.
3. **Share**. Divide data into regional component. This will guide how to break the national data into regional components by state or county.
4. **Disaggregate**.
