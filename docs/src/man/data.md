# blueNOTE Data Set

This is the SLiDE version of the blueNOTE dataset developed by the [Wisconsin National Data
Consortium (WiNDC)](https://windc.wisc.edu). The SLiDE datastream is built on the groundwork laid by
Thomas F. Rutherford, Andrew Schreiber, Gökçe Akin-Olçum, and Christoph Böhringer.

The data necessary to execute the SLiDE buildstream is stored in the following structure:

```
